This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(mosaic)

data_frame <- data.frame(
  Outcome = rep(c("Outcome1", "Outcome2", "Outcome3"), each = 100),
  Pregnant = sample(c("Yes", "No"), 300, replace = TRUE)
)

# Create the graph
# Assuming 'Pregnant' is the column indicating pregnancy status
# and 'Outcome' is the column with the outcomes you want to visualize

library(ggplot2)

# Create the graph
graph <- ggplot(data_frame, aes(x = Outcome, fill = Pregnant)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray", "lightblue"), 
                    labels = c("No", "Yes")) +
  labs(title = "Health Outcomes by Pregnancy Status", 
       x = "Health Outcome", 
       y = "Count", 
       fill = "Pregnant") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the graph
print(graph)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
